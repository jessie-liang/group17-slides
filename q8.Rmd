## Text Section 1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
print("End of code chunk 1")
```

## Text Section 2

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
print("End of code chunk 2")
```
